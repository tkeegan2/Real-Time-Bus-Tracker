# Real-Time Bus Tracking Project

## Description

The Real-Time Bus Tracking project tracks a bus along the route between the MIT and Harvard campuses. Most of my work was on the JavaScript application. It also relies on use of a key to get the map data.  For security purposes, I have removed my public key information from the JavaScript code.  To run it yourself, you should add your public key in the line noted with a comment that says "add your key here."  This is at line 18.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of a bus on a map.
- Displays bus position on a map with a marker that moves.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a coding application such as VS Code.
3. Add your public key to line 18 of the JavaScript code.
4. Save the files.
5. Open the index.html file your web browser.
6. The map will display with a marker indicating the current location of the bus.
7. The bus's position will be updated in real-time, providing live tracking.

## Future Improvements

I'd like to improve this going forward by having the map be in night mode versus day mode depending on what time it actually is.
